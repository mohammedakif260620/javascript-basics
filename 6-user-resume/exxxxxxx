//example 1:/*Write a dynamic greeter program named greeter.js. The program should ask for your name, then output `Hello, {name}!` where `{name}` is the name you entered:

 
const readline = require("readline-sync");
console.log("welcome to greeter")

const username = readline.question("what is your name:  ");

console.log(`hello ${username} !`);




/*example 2: Create a program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet the 
user with their full name.*/


const readline = require("readline-sync");

const firstname = readline.question("what is your first name:  ");

const lastname = readline.question("what is your last name:  ");

console.log(`hello ${firstname} ${lastname} !`);



//example 3: Create `age.js` program. The code should ask the user to enter their age in the program. Here's an example run:

const readline = require("readline-sync");

console.log("Age generator");

const age = +readline.question("how old are you: ");

console.log(`you are ${age} years old !`);

console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 10} years old  `);
console.log(`In 20 years, you will be ${age + 20} years old  `);
console.log(`In 30 years, you will be ${age + 30} years old  `);
console.log(`In 40 years, you will be ${age + 40} years old  `);
